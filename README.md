# CSharp Paint
A painting/drawing application created using C# and Visual Studio Community 2019 to run a Windows Form. Any user can run this application and draw across the entire canvas with just a click of their mouse! To reset the canvas without having to draw over every pixel with the white pen, click the clear box and it'll be as good as new! A user can also change colors by clicking the corresponding box in the top right corner and create to their heart's desire. Have fun with your new painting app!
